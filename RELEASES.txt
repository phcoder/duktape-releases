0.5.0 (2013-05-17)
------------------

* Built-in number conversion primitives

* Cleanup built-ins, improve test cases for built-ins

0.6.0 (2013-09-21)
------------------

* First round of public API cleanup, and add basic API documentation

* First version of duktape.org website

0.7.0 (2013-10-30)
------------------

* Traceback support improved

* Clean up and document error object properties

* Add prototype objects for buffer and pointer values, and make them object
  coercible

* Proper support for big, little, and "middle endian" environments

* Single file combined source distributable

* Portability and bug fixes

0.8.0 (2013-12-18)
------------------

* Remove DUK_PROFILE model, explicit DUK_OPT_xxx feature options added for
  tuning the build (see web docs)

* Register shuffling added to compiler which mostly eliminates constant and
  temporary register limits

* Reduce code footprint, make built-in data 'const' so that it compiles
  into the 'text' section

* Augment errors created when a built-in error constructor is called as
  a normal function (e.g. "var e = Error('test')")

* Enforce string/buffer length limits to avoid corner cases with strings
  and buffers close to size_t limit

* Ecmascript E5.1 test cases and fixes

* Mark-and-sweep stringtable leak fixed, affected mostly builds without
  reference counting

* Run a few mark-and-sweep passes in duk_destroy_heap() to give finalizers
  a chance to run in most (but not all) cases

* Coroutine yield fixes

* Portability and bug fixes

0.9.0 (2014-02-02)
------------------

* Added duk_gc() API call to force GC, implemented duk_map_string() and
  duk_decode_string()

* Added extended JSON format variants JSONX and JSONC; NULL pointer
  values string now coerce to "null" instead of e.g. "(nil)" to match
  JSONX format

* Added input line number to compiler error messages (e.g. SyntaxErrors)

* Added support for function declarations outside function or program top
  level (also known as "function statements"), with V8-like semantics

* Renamed __duk__ to Duktape for more consistency with Ecmascript conventions,
  and made the following cleanups:

    - removed somewhat useless 'build'
    - added 'env'
    - replaced 'addr' and 'refc' with 'info' which gives more internal info
    - merged 'setFinalizer' and 'getFinalizer' into a single 'fin' call
    - compatibility properties available for now (e.g. __duk__), but will
      be removed after this release

* Removed array size limit for very large array joins

* Improve Unicode handling of Greek final sigma

* Make mark-and-sweep interval relative to current heap size (measured as
  combined object and string count)

* Add DUK_OPT_NO_VOLUNTARY_GC to disable voluntary mark-and-sweep entirely;
  this is useful in timing sensitive applications like games

* Preliminary internal support for periodic bytecode executor interrupts
  which can be used to implement executor step limits, profiling, and
  debugging

* More feature options for build tuning

* More self tests to detect obscure compiler bugs, two's complement
  arithmetic, etc (enable with DUK_OPT_SELF_TESTS)

* Fixed several compile warnings, fixed warnings generated by GCC -Wextra

* Fixed some incorrect assertions (with no underlying bug)

* Fixed a coroutine termination bug which caused assertion errors and
  occasional segfaults when an uncaught error terminated a thread with
  a catch point active

* Fixed a tailcall bug: the current activation was not closed which
  caused variable lookups to fail if an inner function accessed
  variables in the surrounding activation

* Fixed a few bound constructor bugs

* Fixed handling of "get" and "set": they were handled as reserved words
  which prevented valid statements like "var set = 1;"

* Fixed a switch-case bug where code was accepted before the first
  case/default clause

* Fixed a switch-case bug where successive case clauses with no code
  in-between was not handled correctly

* Fixed a for statement control flow bug when the third clause of the for
  statement was empty and a continue was used

* Fixed error lineNumber bug triggered when there was more than 127
  source lines between successive compiled statements

* Fixed some line terminator handling issues

* Fixed relational operator ToPrimitive() coercion order, for some
  operators coercion order was reversed

* Fixed 'with' statement in strict mode (did not throw SyntaxError)

* Fixed strictness handling of an indirect eval call from a strict
  function (eval incorrectly inherited strict mode)

* Several test262 and underscore.js test case fixes (other than above)

* Windows compatibility for both WIN32 and WIN64, tested with MinGW (x86),
  MINGW-w64 (x64), VS2010 Express (x32), VS2013 Express (x32 and x64)

* Portability fixes for non-C99 platforms (like MSVC in VS2010)

* Drop 'full distributable' build, which is replaced by the public GitHub
  repo; simplify Makefiles etc accordingly (this change is not visible in
  the source distributable)

Planned
=======

0.10.0 (2014-XX-XX)
-------------------

* C typing wrapped throughout to allow porting to more exotic platforms,
  e.g. platforms where "int" is a 16-bit type

0.11.0 (2014-XX-XX)
-------------------

1.0.0 (2014-XX-XX)
-------------------

* Feature complete baseline release
